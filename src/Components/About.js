            <p>Software Engineer | Solutions Engineer | Full-Stack Web Developer</p>
            
            <p>Hello world,</p>
             
            <p>I'm Sinara Arliss, a self-driven Software Engineer with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science and over five years of work experience in the Information Technology industry.</p>
            
            <p>I enjoy problem-solving and I love being a Software Engineer because I can combine my creativity and analytical traits to find solutions to complex problems efficiently.
            I'm passionate about coding, innovative technologies and I believe that creating eloquently designed web applications can be an enormous driver in improving and growing an organization.</p>

            <p>I live in New Jersey, USA, near the beatiful Navesink river and I have easy access to the Highlands-NYC Seastreak ferry. I was born in Brazil and I speak English and Portuguese fluently. I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures, new languages and new ways of thinking. It has made me a highly empathetic and open-minded individual,
              who can quickly adapt to changes in the work environment.</p>

            <p>I'm excited to connect with companies and colleagues that inspire me!</p>
