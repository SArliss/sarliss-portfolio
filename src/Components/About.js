            <p> Hello world, I'm Sinara Arliss. </p>
              
            <p> I'm a curious Software Engineer with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science,
            and over five years of experience in the Information Technology field.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I'm truly passionate about coding, I enjoy problem-solving and I'm continuously striving to acquire new skills.
              I love being a developer because I can combine my creativity and analytical traits
              to develop responsive and functional web applications. 
            </p>

            <p>
              I have lived abroad and I speak English and Portuguese fluently. I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures,
              new languages and new ways of thinking. It has made me a highly empathetic and open-minded individual,
              who can quickly adapt to changes in the work environment.
            </p>

            <p>I'm excited to connect with companies and colleagues that inspire me!</p>
